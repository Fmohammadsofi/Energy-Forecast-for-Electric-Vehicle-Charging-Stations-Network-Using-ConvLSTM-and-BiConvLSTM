# Energy-Forecast-for-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Stations-Network-Using-ConvLSTM-and-BiConvLSTM
This work proposes two encoder-decoder models based on convolutional long short-term memory networks (ConvLSTM) and bidirectional ConvLSTM (BiConvLSTM) in combination with the standard long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Data on energy demand from EVCS located in four different cities is used in the proposed models. All datasets are preprocessed to make them suitable for the multi-step time-series learning models to make the framework data-centric. The suggested architecture employs the ConvLSTM and BiConvLSTM to extract the key features from the spatiotemporal data of the energy demand data of the EVCS distributed over time and space.
